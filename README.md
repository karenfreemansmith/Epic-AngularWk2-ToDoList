# angular-todo
Epicodus JavaScript week 2 project to build a todo list with Angular

### User Stories
* As a user, I want to be able to see all my tasks
* As a user, I want a task to have a desription, and I need to know if it's done or not
* As a user, I want to be able to view which tasks are done, and which tasks are not done.
* As a user, I want tasks to start out set to "not done". But I want to be able to click a checkbox to mark them as "done". I would also like the ability to uncheck a box and to mark the tasks as "not done", in case I realize I messed one of them up and I have to do it over.
